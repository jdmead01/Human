# Assignment: Human

Let's get our feet wet with some OOP practice in C#! Build a new .NET console project for this assignment. We will be revisiting your work here in a later assignment.
---
Here's an example to get things started
```javascript
class Human
{
    // Fields for Human
    public string Name;
    public int Strength;
    public int Intelligence;
    public int Dexterity;
    private int health;
     
    // add a public "getter" property to access health
     
    // Add a constructor that takes a value to set Name, and set the remaining fields to default values
     
    // Add a constructor to assign custom values to all fields
     
    // Build Attack method
    public int Attack(Human target)
    {
    }
}
```
* [ ] Create a Human class with four public fields: Name (string) , Strength (int), Intelligence (int), Dexterity (int)
* [ ] Add an additional private field for health (int), and a public property to access or "get" health
* [ ] Add a constructor method that takes a string to initialize Name - and that will initialize Strength, Intelligence, and Dexterity to a default value of 3, and health to default value of 100
* [ ] Let's create an additional constructor that accepts 5 parameters, so we can set custom values for every field.
* [ ] Now add a new method called Attack, which when invoked, should reduce the health of a Human object that is passed as a parameter. The damage done should be 5 * strength (5 points of damage to the attacked, for each 1 point of strength of the attacker). This method should return the remaining health of the target object.
